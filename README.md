### 5. **Practice Problems**

-**Easy Level Problems**: Start with easy problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.

-**Medium Level Problems**: Gradually move to medium-level problems, focusing on time and space complexity.

-**Hard Level Problems**: Tackle hard problems to challenge yourself and solidify your understanding.

### 6. **Advanced Concepts and Competitive Programming**

-**Advanced Graph Algorithms**: Floyd-Warshall, Johnson’s algorithm, etc.

### 7. **Mock Interviews and Real-World Applications**

-**Mock Interviews**: Practice with peers or use platforms that simulate coding interviews.

-**Real-World Applications**: Study how data structures and algorithms are applied in real-world scenarios (e.g., database indexing, networking algorithms).

### 8. **Revision and Consistent Practice**

- Regularly revise concepts.
- Continue solving problems daily to maintain and improve your skills.

This roadmap can be adjusted according to your pace and learning style. The key is to practice consistently and understand the underlying concepts deeply rather than just memorizing solutions.
